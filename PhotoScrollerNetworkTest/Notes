Idea to import image from Photos

ALAssetRepresentation *rep = [asset defaultRepresentation];
CGDataProviderDirectCallbacks callbacks = {
    .version = 0,
    .getBytePointer = NULL,
    .releaseBytePointer = NULL,
    .getBytesAtPosition = getAssetBytesCallback,
    .releaseInfo = releaseAssetCallback,
};
CGDataProviderRef provider = CGDataProviderCreateDirect((void *)CFBridgingRetain(rep), [rep size], &callbacks);
CGImageSourceRef source = CGImageSourceCreateWithDataProvider(provider, NULL);


// Inspired by https://gist.github.com/nitrag/b3117a4b6b8e89fdbc12b98029cf98f8
+ (UIImage *)imageFromView:(UIView *)view subsection:(CGRect)subRect
{
    // Image will be sized to the smaller rectangle
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(subRect.size, YES, 0);

    // The primary view needs to shift up and left so the desired rect is visible
    // But the rect passed below needs to be sized to the view, otherwise the image is compressed
    CGRect drawRect = CG
    [self drawViewHierarchyInRect:imageSpecs.drawRect afterScreenUpdates:NO];  // must be same size as the view being drawn. Use NO otherwise iOS complains
    UIImage *img = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return img;
}
